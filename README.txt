# SchoolTesting

# The script are written in R (version: R/3.6.0-foss-2018a-bare)

# The simulations are run on the VSC infrustructure (https://www.vscentrum.be/)
# in order to run the simulation you need to add your budget code on the file "start-vsc.sh"
# All the simulation functions are collected in "nCov_simulator_testing.R" and "SimFunctionsTesting.R"
# By adapting "start-vsc.sh" and "testing.pbs" it is possible to run the scripts on a normal computer.

# The script "strat-vsc.sh" starts all the simulations reported in "scenarios_september.csv"

# The scipt "CodePlotsNew.R" is used to reproduced all the Figures reported in the manuscript.
